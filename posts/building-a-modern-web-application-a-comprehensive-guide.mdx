## Choosing Your Tech Stack

Selecting the right technologies for your project is crucial. Here are some popular choices for modern web development:

- Frontend: React, Vue.js, Angular
- Backend: Node.js, Python (Django/Flask), Ruby on Rails
- Database: PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL
- API: REST, GraphQL
- Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP/Azure

Consider factors like scalability, community support, and your team's expertise when making your choice.

## Frontend Development

Modern frontend development often revolves around component-based architectures. Let's look at a simple React component:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
